"Features" that I've found
==========================

Sockets aren't released when program is finished running
  Fixed with MPI?

If two or more people try to start a program at the same time they 
try to grab each other's nards...I mean nodes.  :-)

Long expressions don't compile: Out of s_expr blocks!
