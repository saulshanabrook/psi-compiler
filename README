Each version now has it's own copy of the doc and examples directory as they
were when that version was finished.  The new tree looks something like this:

Compiler -- mc ----- doc 
	         |
                 --- examples
		 |
		 --- people ----- bruce
		 |	      |
		 |	      --- thom
		 |	      |
		 |	      --- maryjo (joint bruce/thom directory)
                 --- report
                 |
		 --- src
                 |
		 --- v0.2 ----- doc
