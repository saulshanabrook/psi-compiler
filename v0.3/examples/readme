There are a few examples in this directory.  The ex?.m are just made up
expressions to illustrate the C output the compiler can generate.  One of 
the examples is an implementation of lu decomposition.  lu.m is the MOA source
for lu decomposition.  lu_main.c is a C program that calls the LU function in
lu.m to show an example of the C interface.  The makefile is setup to compile
the program lu including moalib.c which contains a couple of runtime functions
used by our compiler's output programs.

In order to try these examples you need to edit the makefile changing only
the CC and MC lines to suit your configuration.  CC needs to be the name
of an ansi C compiler and MC needs to be ../mc_next or ../mc_sun for whichever
machine you might be on.
