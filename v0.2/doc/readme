  This compiler has been produce as part of the Psi Compiler Project at
the University of Missouri-Rolla.  The compiler preforms reductions on 
array operations eleminating temporary storage.  The reduction scheme is
based on the Psi Calculus developed by Dr. Lenore Mullin in her PhD 
dissertation ``The Mathematics of Arrays''.  The taget language is C.

  The compiler's usage is:
	mc <source file> [output file]
The source file is list of procedures containing array expressions.  If there
is an output file the C source is written there, or to the screen otherwise.
The grammer for the input file can be found in the file m.grammer.  The
operators that are currently implemented include (p)take, (p)drop, psi, cat,
omega, +, -, *, and /.  All operators use infix notation.  Omega can now 
take itself as an operator but the partition vector argument to omega
must be a constant vector.
  The new grammer also includes two special operators ptake and pdrop these
are identical to take and drop only the require positive values in the left
argument.  This produces faster C output and is of course why they were added.
A forall statement was included which should be fairly self explanatory looking
at the example program.  You should however look at the grammer as well since
there are a lot of new things you can do including a interface to C.
