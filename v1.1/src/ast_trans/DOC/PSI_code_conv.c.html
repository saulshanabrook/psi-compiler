<center><h2>PSI_code_conv.c Module</h2></center><p>
<h3><b>Description</b>: Along with PGI_PSI.h, implements the PSI_PGI stack.
Contains driver functions which the PSI_PGI module will use to pass
data and messages to the PSI_PGI stack.  <b>Note</b>: In this documentation,
a "pointer to expression" refers to that expression's index in the AST
lookup table.<p>

<ul>
<li><b>db_init_psi</b>: Used by PSI_PGI module.
  <br>Inputs: none
  <br>Output: none
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>PSI_PGI stack is empty.
  </ul>
<li><b>db_push_ast</b>: Used throughout this module.
  <br>Inputs:<ul>
  <li>cur_expr: A pointer to the expression being pushed.
  </ul>
  Output: none
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>The stack has been initialized prior to first push.
  </ul>
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  cur_expr will be top item on stack.
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>I don't check the return from my call to malloc.  This will need
  to be added.
  </ul>
<li><b>db_pop_ast</b>: Used throughout this module.
  <br>Inputs: none
  <br>Output: Pointer to expression stored on the top of stack.
    0 if stack is empty.
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  Node storing expression will be removed from stack and freed.
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>Certain statements may cause the empty-stack warning message to appear.
  This does not necessarily mean that an error has occured.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_FAOPEN</b>: Used by PSI_PGI module.
  <br>Inputs:<ul>
  <li>name: the string name of the index of the do loop to be created. 
  <li>curst: the point of insertion into the statement list.
  </ul>
  Output: none
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>The expression representing loop index's stride is in the first (top)
  node of the PSI_PGI stack.
  <li>The expression representing loop index's stop is in the second node
  of the PSI_PGI stack.
  <li>The expression representing loop index's start is in the third node
  of the PSI_PGI stack.
  <li>Stop represents the bound of the loop.
  </ul>
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>A new do loop node will be inserted into the pghpf statement list, just
  before curst.
  <li>The top three nodes will be removed from the PSI_PGI stack.
  </ul>
  <ul>Actions:
  <li>A new AST node is allocated.
  <li>The loop index is found be looking up <em>name</em> in the symbol
  table.
  <li>The label field of the do-loop node is set to NULL.
  <li>Stride, stop, and start information are retrieved from the PSI_PGI stack.
  <li>A new expression representing ((stop - 1) * stride) is built and
  stored into the stop field of the do-loop.  start and stride are inserted.
  <li>New statement holding do-loop AST is inserted into statement list.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_FACLOSE</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>curst: the point of insertion into the statement list.
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>A new do loop node will be inserted into the pghpf statement list, just
  before curst.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_FASECT</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul>
  <li>name: name of array to be subscripted
  </ul>
  Output: none
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>The expressions representing array section's strides are in the first
  (top) <em>dim</em> node of the PSI_PGI stack, where dim is the dimension
  of the array being subscripted.
  <li>The expressions representing array section's bounds are in the next dim
  nodes of the PSI_PGI stack, after the strides.
  <li>The expressions representing array section's starts are in the next dim
  nodes of the PSI_PGI stack, after the bounds.
  </ul>
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>The top three node will be removed from the stack.
  <li>A new subscript node will be created and pushed onto the stack.
  </ul>
  <ul>Actions:
  <li>The name is used to locate the array in the symbol table.  An AST
  representing the array identifier is created, and the dimensionality of
  the array is noted.
  <li>The strides, bounds, and starts are removed from the PSI_PGI stack.
  <li>New starts are computed by adding in the starting index of the
  subscripted array.
  <li>New stops are computed by adding to the new start, (bound - 1) * stride.
  <li>Triples are formed using the new stops, starts, and strides.
  <li>Using the array identifier and the set of triples, a subscript AST
  is formed and pushed onto the stack.
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>As the name of this function indicates, the subscripting may be in
  terms of a forall index.  New starts and stops are now constructed using
  binary operator AST's.  This would be a good opportunity for optimization.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_ARRAY</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>name: name of the array identifier
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>A node representing an array identifier will be added to the top of
  the stack.
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>No shape information is being passed.  If the Psi compiler produces
  a temporary array, this allows me to create a new entry based on the
  name, but the use of such an array is largely untested.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_SCALAR</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul>
  <li>name: name of the scalar identifier
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>A node representing a scalar identifier will be added to the top of
  the stack.
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>This routine should pose no problems if the scalar is introduced by
  the Psi compiler.  Although I use this for temporary scalars in evaluating
  subexpressions, these disappear by the time the final HPF statement is
  formed.  Testing with the do-loop index should tell whether this function
  is sufficient.
  <li>No accommodations have been made for initial values; it appears
  that the Psi compiler does all initializations in the form statements
  rather than in variable declarations.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_CONS</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>v: value of constant.
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>A node representing a constant with value v will be added to the top
  of the stack,
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>v is an integer, so doubles are cast.  This should be fine for the
  benchmarks, but in the future, we may want to provide a separate routine
  for floating points.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_BINOP</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>optype: type of binary operation
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>The right operand is stored in the first (top) node of the PSI_PGI stack.
  <li>The left operand is stored in the second node of the PSI_PGI stack.
  <li>optype is in the range 1-28.
  </ul>
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>The top two nodes of the PSI_PGI stack are removed.
  <li>A new node representing the binary operation will be pushed onto
  the stack.
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>Unlike the binop routine provided in the PGI_PSI module, this one is
  used directly by the client.  I did this to save time.  I included the
  optype macros in the PGI_PSI module for reference.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_SUBSCR</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>name: name of array to be subscripted
  <li>start: array of integers starting indices (1 per dimension)
  <li>stop: array of bounds (1 per dimension)
  <li>stride: array of strides (1 per dimension)
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>A subscript node is pushed onto the stack.
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>Not used currently.  Doesn't allow for scalars (specifically, loop
  indices) in indexing information.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_EXPR</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>index1: index of lhs/lop of new expression
  <li>optype: holds optype of subexpression (unused for assignments)
  <li>do_assign: if non_zero, assignment statement.  otherwise, binop.
  <li>dont_pop: if non_zero, rhs/rop is a previously computed subexpression.
  otherwise, rhs/rop is top item on stack.
  <li>index2: index of subexpression
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>If dont_pop is 0, then stack must be non-empty.
  <li>If do_assign is 0, then optype is in the range 1-28.
  <li>If do_assign is 0, then index1 is the index of a previously formed
  subexpression.
  </ul>
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>index1 of the subexpression table will contain a pghpf expression,
  either an assignment or a binary operation.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_ASS_EXPR</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>cur_stmnt: the point of insertion into the statement list. 
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>Index 0 of the subexpression table contains the RHS for this assignment.
  <li>The top element of the stack contains the LHS for this assignment.
  </ul>
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>The top element of the stack will be removed.
  <li>A new assignment node will be inserted into the pghpf statement list,
  just before cur_stmnt.
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>The original approach to subscripting resulted in extraneous assignment
  statements being added to the statement list.  After inserting this
  assignment statement, the function checks the <em>previous</em> statement
  to see whether the LHS of that statement is identical to the one just
  inserted.  If so, then the earlier statement is removed.
  <li>For robustness, this check should probably verify that the previous
  statement is also an assignment statement.  It does not do so currently.
  <li>After testing, I would advise removing the final code segment that
  involves checking the previous statement.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_LOP_MATCH</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>lop_name: string to be matched
  <li>cur_stmnt: pointer to current location in statement list
  </ul>
  Output: A pointer to the last assignment statement previous to cur_stmnt
  that has a LHS with a name that matches lop_name.
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>LHS of assignments between these two statements are all subscript nodes.
  <li>Such an assignment statement exists.
  </ul> 
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>The assignment statement that meets the above conditions will be
  removed from the statement list.
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>Because I am not checking the type of each statement, this routine
  is not at all robust.
  <li>The original approach to subscripting resulted in extraneous assignment
  statements being added to the statement list.  This function is not no
  longer being used.
  </ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_NEWST</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul>
  <li>lop: name of array to be used in left-hand operand of operation
  <li>rop: name of array to be used in right-hand operand of operation
  <li>optype: type of binary operation
  <li>cur_stmnt: pointer to current location in statement list
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>PSI_LOP_MATCH is valid for both lop and rop as the first argument,
  and cur_stmnt as the second argument.
  <li>optype is in the range 1-28.
  </ul>
  <br>Notes:<ul>
  <li>Not used anymore.
  <li>When the use of omega with psi and iota causes <em>temp_vect</em>s to
  appear, the breakdown of expressions no longer occurs at the subexpression
  level.  Rather, it is represented at the statement level.  This function
  was written to scan for previous assignment statements with the goal
  of reconstructing larger expressions.
  </ul>
</ul>
