<h3><b>Description</b>: Contains functions which traverse Psi statement
list and passes information to PSI_PGI stack.  Requests PSI_PGI stack
to make pghpf do loops and assignment statements which are added to the
pghpf statement list.<p>
</h3>
<tt>
<ul>
<li><b>PSI_PGI_AST</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>cur: a pointer to the current Psi statement
  <li>curst: the point of insertion into the pghpf statement list.
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>The Psi program starting at cur will be translated and equivalent
  pghpf statements will be added before curst.
  </ul>
  <br>Warnings:<ul>
  <li>The only type of node in the statement list I am sure is handled
  correctly is the REDUCED type.
  <li>Code may have to be added to open and close loops for the LOOP
  type if this case ever shows up in the future.
  </ul>
<li><b>psi_code_reduced</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>reduced: a reduced Psi statement
  <li>curst: the point of insertion into the pghpf statement list.
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>Type of <em>reduced</em> is in {SKIP, NOP, ALLOCATE, FORALL, EX_OP}.
  </ul>
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>The Psi statement <em>reduced</em> will be translated and an equivalent
  statement (or, in the case of a forall loop, statements) will be added
  to the pghpf statement list before curst.
  </ul>
  <br>Actions:<ul>
  <li>In the case of NOP, the list of statements in the field <em>list</em>
  will correspond to a two-address intermediate representation of a
  statement I must reconstruct.  The function psi_code_expr will process
  this list, and then this function requests the PSI_PGI stack to form the
  assignment statement.
  <li>In the case of FORALL, this node contains one or more nested loops.
  Loops are opened (by requesting pghpf to create a do-loop node), the
  body of the loop is then translated (and added to the statement list),
  and then the loops are closed (by requesting pghpf to create a end-do-loop
  node).
  </ul>
<li><b>psi_code_expr</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>reduced: a reduced Psi statement
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>Index 0 of the PSI_PGI subexpression table will contain the RHS
  expression of an assignment statement corresponding to <em>reduced</em>.
  <li>The top node of the PSI_PGI stack will contain the LHS expression
  of an assignment statement corresponding to <em>reduced</em>.
  </ul>
<li><b>psi_global_assign</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>global: 
  <li>result:
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Notes:<ul>
  <li>Currently being rewritten
  </ul>
<li><b>pgi_ident2array</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>id: a pointer to the identifier to be converted.
  <li>dim: the dimensionality of the target vector.
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Notes:<ul>
  <li>Not used anymore.
  <li>When omega was combined with psi and omega, the indexing information
  i needed for the array access nodes in the body of the loop was not being
  passed down, so this routine copied the information into global arrays
  which global_assign would use when the array access nodes were reached.
  <li>This routine employs nothing but side effects.  Each call results
  in one of the global arrays for stop, start, or stride to be filled with
  <em>dim</em> values, and global flags are read to and written from to
  control which array is used for storage.
  </ul>
<li><b>pgi_swalk</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>se: a scalar expression to be converted to pghpf form.
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>A node representing <em>se</em> converted to pghpf form will be on
  the top of the PSI_PGI stack.
  </ul>
<li><b>pgi_vect2array</b>: Currently being rewritten
  <br>Inputs:<ul> 
  <li>source: the vector to be converted
  <li>dim: the dimensionality of the vector
  </ul>
  Output: none 
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>The vector will be converted to pghpf form and pushed onto the top
  of the PSI_PGI stack.
  <li>The vector will be pushed on in reverse order, i.e. source[0] will
  be stored in the top node of the stack.
  </ul>
  </ul>
