<h3><b>Description</b>: Contains functions which traverse <i>hpfsrc</i>
statement list and passes information to PGI_PSI stacks.  Calls psi_reduce
on valid assignment statements.<p>
</h3>
<tt>
<ul>
<li><b>PGI_PSI_AST</b>: Used by <i>pghpf</i>
  <br>Inputs:<ul>
  <li>cur_stmnt: Typically, a pointer to the first pghpf-encoded statement
  of an HPF program.
  </ul>
  Output: none
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>cur_stmnt is a valid statement pointer.
  <li>Statement list is terminated with an A_END ast.
  </ul>
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>Assignment statements will be replaced by equivalent, Psi-reduced
  statements.  Typically, program will be consist of many more statements
  after the call to PGI_PSI_AST.
  </ul>
  <br>Actions:<ul>
  <li>Traverses statement list; isolates assignment statements.
  <li>Initializes Psi reduction engine for each assignment statement.
  <li>Attempts to convert LHS and RHS of assignment statement.
  <li>If successful, then it requests the Psi compiler to reduce an
  assignment statement.
  <li>If not, then clears the PGI_PSI stack.
  <li>Remove original statement from list.
  </ul>
<li><b>PGI_CONV_AST</b>
  <br>Inputs:<ul>
  <li>cur: A pghpf AST to be converted
  </ul>
  Output: 1 if the conversion was successful, 0 otherwise.
  <br>Preconditions:<ul>
  <li>All nodes to the left of cur (as defined by DFS) in the program tree
  have been previously visited.
  </ul>
  <br>Postconditions:<ul>
  <li>If the conversion was successful, an equivalent Psi expression
  will be on the top of the PGI_PSI stack.
  </ul>
  <br>Actions:<ul>
  <li>Depth First Search is done on each AST.
  <li>Atomic objects (leaves) are processed by passing appropriate symbol
  table information to the PGI_PSI stack.
  [<i>opportunity for optimization?</i>]
  <li>Internal nodes are processed by visiting the children (leftmost first),
  followed by calling the appropriate PGI_PSI_ routine to reconstruct the
  equivalent expression from the PGI_PSI stack.
  <li>More specific information about how the different intrinsic functions
  are handled can be found in my writeup or in PGI_PSI.c itself.
  </ul>
<li><b>isspread</b>: Used by check_spr
  <br>Inputs:<ul>
  <li>cur: pghpf AST
  </ul>
  Output: 1 if cur represents a direct call to intrinsic function SPREAD,
   0 otherwise.
<li><b>check_spr</b>: Used by PGI_CONV_AST
  <br>Inputs:<ul>
  <li>cur: pghpf AST
  </ul>
  <br>Output:<ul>
  <li>1 if cur represents a direct call to intrinsic function SPREAD
  <li>2 if cur represents an indirect call to intrinsic function SPREAD.
      Call would be parenthesized if the result is being subscripted.
  <li>0 otherwise.
  </ul>
</ul>
